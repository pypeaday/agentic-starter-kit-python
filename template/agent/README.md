# Agent Workspace

This directory serves as the workspace for AI agents collaborating on this project. It follows a simplified structure to optimize focus and maintain essential context.

## Directory Structure

```
agent/
├── context/     # Project context & constraints
│   ├── goals.md          # Project objectives
│   └── constraints.md    # Project limitations
├── current/     # Active task & notes
│   ├── task.md          # Current task details
│   └── notes.md         # Working notes
└── history/     # Decisions & progress
    ├── decisions/       # Key technical decisions
    └── progress.md      # Development progress
```

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Active Development**
   - Keep current task details in current/task.md
   - Use current/notes.md for temporary work
   - Clean up after task completion

2. **Context Management**
   - Review relevant files in context/
   - Reference goals.md and constraints.md
   - Keep documentation focused

3. **Progress Tracking**
   - Document decisions in history/decisions/
   - Update progress in history/progress.md
   - Use [TODO] and [DONE] markers

## Best Practices

- Work on one task at a time
- Keep documentation minimal but clear
- Document important decisions
- Clean up workspace after completion
