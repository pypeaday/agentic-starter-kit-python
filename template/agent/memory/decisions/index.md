# Decisions Log

## [2025-01-25] Initial Project Structure

### Context
Need to establish a template structure for agent-assisted development projects that maintains clear context and enables efficient collaboration.

### Options Considered
1. Traditional project structure with docs/
   - Pros: Familiar to developers
   - Cons: Not optimized for agent interaction
2. Agent-centric structure
   - Pros: Better supports AI collaboration
   - Cons: New pattern to learn
3. Hybrid approach
   - Pros: Balances familiarity with AI optimization
   - Cons: More complex structure

### Selected Approach
Agent-centric structure with clear separation of context, memory, and workspace

### Rationale
- Optimizes for AI-human collaboration
- Maintains clear context boundaries
- Enables efficient knowledge transfer
- Supports incremental development

### Implications
- New project structure pattern to document
- Need for clear usage guidelines
- Potential learning curve for teams
- Better long-term maintainability
