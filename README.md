# Agentic Start Kit For Python Projects

This repository contains the Agentic Start Kit For Python Projects, a template
for new python projects that includes the basic structure and documentation
required for a successful project.

There are a few TODOs in `instructions/design` for you to fill out depending on
what your project needs. Also feel free to edit any of the other documentation
to better fit your project.

Once you are satisfied with the structure and content of `agent/` you can
remove this README to replace it with one relevant to your project.

Happy prompting!
